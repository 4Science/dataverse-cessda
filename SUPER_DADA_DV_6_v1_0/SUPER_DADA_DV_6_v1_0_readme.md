# SUPER DADA for Dataverse version 6

SUPER DADA is a shell script (`SUPER_DADA_DV_6_v1_0_script.sh`) that adapts XML-DDI metadata files produced by Dataverse to make them compliant with the technical requirements of the [CESSDA Data Catalogue](https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/) (CDC).

'SUPER DADA' stands for **S**cript for **Up**dating **E**lectronic **R**ecords: From **Da**taverse to CESS**DA**.

This version of the script is specifically refactored for **Dataverse version 6** and is fully compliant with the [DDI 2.5 Profile 3.0.0](https://zenodo.org/records/10696481).

The script was originally developed and documented in April-May 2021 by Youssef Ouahalou with the help of Benjamin Peuch for the [SODHA repository](https://www.sodha.be/) at the [State Archives of Belgium](http://www.arch.be/index.php?l=en). The second version was completed in June-July 2021.

**This version has been reviewed and adapted in 2025 by Alfredo Cosco from 4Science to work with Dataverse 6 and to ensure compliance with DDI 2.5 Profile 3.0.0.**

## Version history and project status

This is the **Dataverse 6** version of SUPER DADA.

The script includes:

- Support for Dataverse 6 export files.
- Compliance with the [CESSDA Data Catalogue (CDC) DDI 2.5 Profile 3.0.0](https://zenodo.org/records/10696481).
- Improved handling of country codes in the `@abbr` attribute of `<nation>` elements.

## What the script does

SUPER DADA modifies XML-DDI files produced by a Dataverse 6 installation so that the files become fully compliant with the 'BASIC' level of validation of the [CESSDA Metadata Validator](https://cmv.cessda.eu/#!validation) against the CESSDA Data Catalogue (CDC) DDI 2.5 Profile 3.0.0.

<span style="color:red">**WARNING: This script <u>overwrites</u> the contents of metadata export files. It does not create separate, edited copies of the files. Consider backing up your metadata before running the script.**</span>

As per the CDC requirements, which stem from the [CESSDA Metadata Model](https://zenodo.org/records/7528240), SUPER DADA adds

- **elements**
  - `<holdings>`
  - `<distDate>`

- and **attributes**
  - `@xml:lang`
  - `@vocab`
  - `@URI` (in `<holdings>`)
  - `@date` (in `<distDate>`)
  - `@abbr` (in `<nation>`)

which are either not present by default in the DDI files produced by Dataverse or not present at the right place according to the profile's specifications.

## Prerequisites

Because this script is tailored for Dataverse, you need to run it on **Linux**.

Place the script anywhere on the server where you have installed Dataverse, preferably in the Payara (formerly, GlassFish) directory.

The user who executes the script must have **access to the folders** in which the export metadata files are stored.

The script relies on standard Unix tools such as `xmlstarlet`. You can install it with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install xmlstarlet
```

The script will fetch the export metadata files where they are created with **default file storage**, i.e. "file (Default)." Adjustments might be required with other storage modes (AWS, etc.).

## Two steps

First, you will need to run the script without the `-mtime` parameter in order to edit all of your metadata export files.

Then you can set it to run periodically with said parameter so that only the most recent files are modified (see comments in the code).
